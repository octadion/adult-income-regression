# Adult Income Regression

## Project Overview

This project involves the implementation of a classification model using various machine learning algorithms to predict a target variable. 
The dataset is loaded, preprocessed, and used to train different classification models. 
The evaluation of the models is conducted using metrics such as confusion matrix, learning curves, and other relevant performance indicators.
## Overall Steps:
1. Import all Libraries & Load the Dataset
   Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.
   Load the dataset for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   Analyze categorical and numerical data for insights into the dataset.
3. Spit the Dataset
   Divide the dataset into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.
4. Feature Engineering: Train and Test
    Drop duplicated data.
    Handle missing values.
5. Encoding
6. Scaling
   Standardize the features using Standard Scaler.
7. Modelling Classification ML Algorithms:
    Linear Regression
    Random Forest Regressor
    Gradient Boosting Regressor
8. Evaluation Model:
    Confusion Matrix Evaluation
    Learning curve Linear Regression
    Learning curve Random Forest Regressor
    Learning curve Gradient Boosting Regressor
9. Hyperparameter Tuning
